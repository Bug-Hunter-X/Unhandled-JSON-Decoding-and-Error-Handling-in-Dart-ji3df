# Unhandled JSON Decoding and Error Handling in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code: insufficient error handling when dealing with network requests and JSON decoding. The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code assumes that the API always returns a JSON response. It doesn't check the `Content-Type` header or handle cases where the response might not be valid JSON, leading to runtime exceptions.  The error handling is also minimal, lacking specific error messages and potential logging to aid in debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves:

1. **Checking response status codes:** Ensure the request is successful (200 OK) before attempting to parse the response body.
2. **Verifying response content type:** Confirm that the response is indeed JSON using the `Content-Type` header.
3. **Robust JSON decoding:** Using `jsonDecode` within a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during decoding.
4. **Improved error handling:** Providing more informative error messages that indicate the specific nature of the failure.  Consider more comprehensive error reporting using logging libraries.

This improved code is more robust and provides better error handling, leading to a more stable and maintainable application.
